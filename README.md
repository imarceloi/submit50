# TODO app - CS50's

This project is a todo app whit pure javascript to learn and pratice javascript and react native. <br />
Based on [CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50M+Mobile/course/)

## Run

I'm use a NPM for dependencies and [Bulma](https://bulma.io) for styles. <br />
To install dependencies run `npm i`. <br />
So to edit styles this project you need run `npm run css-build` or `npm run start` (what start a sass watch, and detect new changes in real time).
